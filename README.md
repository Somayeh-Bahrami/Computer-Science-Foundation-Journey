# CS_Foundation_Journey
This repository documents my structured academic preparation for graduate studies in Computer Science. As an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate transitioning to Computer Science, this repository showcase my systematic approach to building essential CS foundations through comprehensive coursework, concept summaries, mini-projects, and practical implementations covering key foundational topics including programming, data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. The goal is to demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical skills necessary for successful graduate-level applications and coursework.
